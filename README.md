What this program does:
========================================

This Python script is a simple Computer Vision project, which automatically detects Sunspots (dark-regions on the solar-disk) from a solar image.

This program uses openCV - a well-known Computer Vision library to accomplish this task.

To use this program, please use the sample solar image saved as Sample.jpg.

To use alternative solar images, please consider using the following sources:
- Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/
- Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) https://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/

This program is more suited for detecting sunspots from Intensitygrams from the aforementioned sources and is only a simple uncalibrated example of how sunspots can be detected.

Python libraries used:
========================================

This program originally ran in Python 3.7, with the following packages installed:

- opencv-python v 4.0.0.21
- numpy v 1.16.1
- scipy v 1.2.0
